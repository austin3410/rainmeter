# rainmeter
All of my Rainmeter configs.

Setup Instrusctions:

  		Simply download the .rmskin files in simple_installers and run those.
  		The music visualization is currently setup for a 27" 1440p screen.
		To make sure the vizualizer is in the middle of the screen, click the Fountain of Colors.ini in:
		"Fountain of Colors\Fountain of Colors.ini"
		In the 1st Coordinates box set that number to 9999. The number will auto change to it max value.
		Divide that max value by 2 and set the 1st box to that divided value.
		This will ensure its in the middle.
		Leave the second box at 0, as this adjusts the height of the visualizer.
		To change the characteristics of the visualizer, load the settings box:
		"Fountain of Colors\SettingsWindow\SettingsWindow.ini"
		You will mainly want to adjust the number of bars to fit it on your screen.
  		Remember to authenticate the Now Playing skin with your Spotify account for full functionality.		
		Once you have everything in place. I recommend setting the taskbar to auto hide when not in use.

Selecting Wallpapers:
		
		This setup works best with minimalistic or dark wallpapers.
		simpledesktops.com is a good website to get nice minimal design desktops.... or Google.

Use cases:
			
		Ambient view for TV or spare monitor.
