# rainmeter
All of my Rainmeter configs.

Setup Instrusctions:

  		Simply download the .rmskin files in simple_installers and run those.
  		The music visualization is currently setup for a 27" 1440p screen.
  		Remember to authenticate the Now Playing skin with your Spotify account for full functionality.		
		Once you have everything in place. I recommend setting the taskbar to auto hide when not in use

Selecting Wallpapers:
		
		This setup works best with minimalistic or dark wallpapers.
		simpledesktops.com is a good website to get nice minimal design desktops.... or Google.

Use cases:
			
		Ambient view for TV or spare monitor.
